a simple example how to query a postgres database using natural language. 

the sample database is hosted on supabase and contains swimming results for a local swim club from zionsville, indiana. 

make sure to add your supabase and openai credentials before using. 

this is my very first project in any kind of programming. 
i am sure there may be mistakes. use at your own risk :-)
